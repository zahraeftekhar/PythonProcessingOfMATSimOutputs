    "# SnapShot preprocessing:\n",
    "In this notebook we get the MATSim snapShot output as the input. MATSim gives us the user location in constant intervals. It does not report anything when the user is not traveling. So to make this data as much as possible closer to the actual periodic location update, we have to fill in the empty records. also we initially get the snapshots every 30 seconds. For other polling intervals we only reduce the accuracy. Also for the spatial aggregation to the level os TAZ zones, we use arcGIS to extract the associated TAZ of each location record from the snapShot file. The output of arcGIS is the input here."
